### What I learned

- Wrapper is Key: The wrapper (parent container) is primarily responsible for the layout and positioning of its children using Flexbox properties.
- Children Styles: Apply additional styles to individual children when we need specific control over their appearance or spacing within the wrapper, but the overall positioning is typically managed by the wrapper.
- Consistency: This approach remains consistent whether we have 1 child or multiple children in the container.
- So, even with 3 children, we still apply Flexbox properties to the wrapper to control their overall alignment and positioning relative to each other. Then, we can apply additional styles directly to individual children if needed.
